System administrator, Linux Engineer, DevOps, Surfer, Skater, Biker, and a lot of other things

Hi, I am Marcio!
As an IT professional with over two decades of experience in infrastructure, automation, and DevOps,
I am excited to apply for the DevOps Engineer position at AltScore. With a strong background in
Linux and FreeBSD since 1998 and a career spanning from 2000, I have honed my expertise in system
administration, cloud computing, container orchestration, and CI/CD pipelines. My experience
working in both Brazilian and U.S. companies has given me a global perspective and adaptability to
different work environments.
I thrive in automating workflows and optimizing infrastructure to ensure reliability, scalability, and
security. My deep knowledge of networking, virtualization, and scripting (Bash, Terraform, Ansible,
and Python) allows me to deliver efficient solutions that drive business growth. Recently, I have been
developing custom shell scripts, github actions and several automations using ansibleâ€”
demonstrating my ability to manage complex projects from conception to deployment.
Beyond my technical expertise, I am a strong problem-solver with a passion for innovation. My
fluency in English, advanced Spanish skills, and experience collaborating with multidisciplinary
teams make me an effective communicator and team player. I am eager to bring my skills to the
company and contribute to your mission of delivering cutting-edge technology solutions.
I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience aligns with your needs. Thank you for your
time and considerationâ€”I look forward to hearing from you.
